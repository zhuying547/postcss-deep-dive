# postcss-deep-dive

PostCSS takes CSS and turns it into a form of data that JavaScript can manipulate.

PostCSS plugins can behave like preprocessors: they can optimize and autoprefix code, they can add future syntax, they can perform linting, they can process variables and logic, they can provide complete grid systems, they can offer coding shortcutsâ€¦ the list is long and varied.

**You can always apply PostCSS to the compiled CSS.**
